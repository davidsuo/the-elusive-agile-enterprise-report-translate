## FOREWORD 前言

As the second decade of the 21st century draws to a close, we’re inundated with constant reminders of how much—and how quickly—change can occur across all major human endeavors.
Forces for change and innovation buffet the business world from all corners of the market, with even the world’s oldest and best-known brands daily confronting new challenges from traditional competitors, regulators, policymakers and well-funded, tech-driven upstarts. And when change is this constant—and this meaningful—only the most Agile can thrive.
The companies that are winning in this new era are those that can respond to change with agility—not by resisting it, but by harnessing its forces to rally and augment their own. When the market shifts, they evolve along with it. When competitors emerge, they bring greater innovations to consumers in newer, better ways. They operate like ships that can maneuver around troubled storms, rather than trains that plow straight ahead on a predetermined course that no one—not even the engineer—can change.
For years, certain corporate functions have operated under this paradigm. These “Agile” groupings could be found in the IT department, among software developers and in product teams. As this new way of working has begun to show immense gains in productivity, there has been a growing awareness that these same ways of working could be adopted and adapted by the larger organization.
This Forbes Insights report provides the first detailed look into the broader “Agile transformations” now taking place within companies in every industry and around the globe. The survey data provides a rich source of information about where and how these transformations are occurring, while the accompanying interviews provide real-world advice and lessons learned from those heading the charge.
 A key finding of this report is the importance of C-suite-level buy-in for any transformation to be successful. For companies already in the midst
of their own Agile transformations, this report provides an important look at the breadth and pace of change in other companies. For leaders of companies still standing on the edge of the pool, waiting
to see if they should dive in, this report should be an excellent conversation starter.
Most companies realize they need to change, but they may not know how. Here’s where the learning can begin—or continue.

 4 | THE ELUSIVE AGILE ENTERPRISE: HOW THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP MINDSET, WORKFORCE AND CULTURE CAN TRANSFORM YOUR ORGANIZATION

## INTRODUCTION 介绍

Many organizations are undergoing major transformations in reaction to changing customer needs, fluctuating market demands, competitive pressures and disruptive technologies. But less than half of executives (47%) believe they can extract sustainable value from these transformations, according to research from Forbes Insights. In addition, only half of executives (51%) believe they can create short-term transformation wins.
Complicating matters is that, at any given point, a third of all large companies are experiencing a severe deterioration in total shareholder value, and successful recovery from this deterioration is the exception rather than the norm: Only one-quarter of companies are able to outperform their industry in the short and long run after the point of deterioration, according to findings published on the MIT Sloan Management Review website.
Part of the problem is that many organizations continue to function under rigid vertical organizational structures—vestiges of the industrial era. Today’s modern, digital, networked businesses must acknowledge the innate ineffectiveness of traditional management while recognizing the urgent need for greater agility, an organizational approach defined by quick iterative cycles and empowered cross-functional teams engaged in discovering and delivering customer value.
To better understand this approach and its advantages, Forbes Insights, in collaboration with Scrum Alliance, surveyed more than 1,000 C-level executives from around the globe and from a range of industries. Questions explored executives’ overall view on the importance of agility, how it correlates with success in transformation efforts, and how far along companies are with implementing these frameworks. We also conducted in-depth interviews with leading C-level executives from top-tier organizations including GE Healthcare, Nokia, J. Walter Thompson Company, Toyota Connected, Unisys and Team WIKISPEED.

Based on our research findings and conversations with top executives, we discovered that Agile frameworks—Scrum in particular, which 77% of leading organizations currently leverage— can help spur growth and support digital transformation in an era of fickle customers and fast-emerging market trends. In fact, for organizations that succeed at achieving greater agility, the rewards are plentiful, including: faster time to market (60%), faster innovation (59%), improved non-financial results such as customer experience and product quality (58%), and improved employee morale (57%). These benefits are being realized on a global basis, from Asia-Pacific to the Middle East.
Agility also delivers bottom-line benefits, as 17% of leading companies (see Defining Leaders and Laggards, pg. 5) have experienced revenue growth of more than 20% over the past year, compared with 10% of laggards. Beyond revenue figures, leaders differ from laggards in that they’ve successfully translated agility from a software development methodology into a highly valuable management strategy across their business domain.
This report illustrates the increasing importance of agility as an organizational approach and explores how organizations can achieve end-to- end agility in a highly competitive world.

### DEFINING LEADERS AND LAGGARDS
When looking at the adoption, understanding and implementation of Agile approaches, responses varied significantly among surveyed executives. To highlight these key differences in behavior, our report divides respondents into two main categories: leaders and laggards. These segments are defined as follows:
  LEADERS
LAGGARDS
16%
19%
of the sample

Those who responded:
“We are Agile in both strategy and execution” and “culture is definitely an asset to achieving agility.”
Those who responded:
“We are not Agile in both strategy and execution” and “culture is an obstacle to achieving agility.”

### AGILITY VERSUS AGILE
Agility
A property of an organization to sense and respond to market changes and continuously deliver value to customers.
Agile
An organizational approach and mindset defined by the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto, often practiced through a framework like Scrum.


## KEY FINDINGS
Organizations are increasingly recognizing the value of organizational agility: 81% of all survey
respondents consider it to be the most important characteristic of a successful organization.
For those that succeed at achieving greater agility, the rewards are plentiful: Faster time to market (60%), faster innovation (59%) and improved non-financial results (58%).
Many organizations are adopting an ad-hoc approach to Agile: 21% of respondents use Agile when/where needed, and 23% use it within specific functions. However, adoption needs to be enterprise-wide (and consistent) to realize real results.
The C-suite plays an integral role in driving adoption of agility across the enterprise: 35% of survey respondents say the CEO is responsible for organizational agility, and 87% view the CEO as the biggest proponent of organizational agility.
Not everyone eagerly embraces agility: Longtime employees (29%) are the biggest detractors of organizational agility and may stand in the way of widespread adoption. This is a prime opportunity for senior-level executives to address employee concerns and shift mindset.
As the role of the C-suite changes, organizations must find the right mix of talent—from all business functions—to drive transformation and collaborate with stakeholders: 83% of leaders
cite the right talent and/or skills as being key to a successful transformation.
Education and awareness are central to converting agility from a framework into a management strategy: 54% have trained and/or utilized employees to lead the Agile transformation, and 58% say they
need to learn more about Agile.
Culture is key to supporting an Agile enterprise: 65% of survey respondents agree that their culture is an asset to the organization, and 66% consider agility an essential part of their company’s DNA.
Many organizations eliminate hierarchy in the hopes of increasing agility: 44% of survey respondents have introduced a flatter structure to become more Agile. But that may be premature; Agile is about creating the right dynamics for teams to iterate quickly, not simply moving boxes around on organizational charts.
As agility gains traction around the world, regional differences begin to arise. Asia-Pacific executives say being Agile is very important, but they don’t assess themselves as being particularly good at it. North American executives do, but they don’t necessarily say it’s more important. Latin American executives, on the other hand, characterize their organizations in general as the most disruptive. Despite these nuances, the survey reveals a global consensus among executives on the need to become more Agile.


## THE STATE OF AGILITY 敏捷性的现状？ 敏捷力？
A vast majority of organizations recognize the importance of agility and its rewards. Yet agility can be elusive: Many are struggling to translate this nearly 20-year-old software development strategy into a broader management concept. To successfully transform, today’s organizations need to embrace agility from strategy to execution, and enterprise-wide.
The time to do so is now. Our survey findings indicate that two-thirds (66%) of organizations have experienced less than 10% growth in revenue over the most recent fiscal year. Trends like this make the ability to react quickly to emerging trends, design better products, enhance team morale, and meet sky-high customer expectations more critical than ever.

Organizations already recognize the value of agility to the enterprise. A staggering 81% of all survey respondents consider it to be the most important characteristic of a successful organization. And 82% of respondents consider agility to be very or extremely important to an organization’s success and competitiveness. Among the most popular Agile approaches selected by respondents: Scrum, cited by more than three-quarters (77%) of leaders.
“Agility is a prerequisite to stay
competitive in the long run; it
is not optional,” says Joerg
Erlemeier, chief operating
officer of Nokia, a Finnish mul-
tinational telecommunications
and consumer electronics com-
pany. “Being Agile enables
us to respond faster and
better meet our customers’
requests.” Agile initiatives at Nokia include redesigning business processes, creating a customer-centric supply chain and introducing smaller, more nimble teams.
There’s good reason for the popularity of organizational agility. For those that succeed at achieving greater agility, leaders and laggards see many benefits, including faster time to market, faster innovation and improved non-financial results, to name just a few.
Toyota Motor Corporation is just one company reaping the benefits of increased agility. By working “in small batches” and creating continuous process flows like the Toyota Production System, Nigel Thurlow, chief of Agile for Toyota Connected (the global technology strategy business unit for Toyota), says the company’s Kentucky manufacturing plant can upgrade systems that support the plant machinery in six days—a fraction of the seven weeks once required for the exact same task. “When you’re working in short sprints and small batches, you’re able to see the value delivered more rapidly,” he says. “But more importantly, you’re able to catch your mistakes more rapidly, change your mind and make decisions based upon emerging requirements.”
Such flexibility is imperative in today’s business environment, as the rapid pace of technology, innovation and development requires organizations to deliver results faster than ever. But agility is about more than getting products out the door faster than your competitors. Agile began as a response to the failings of traditional software development. Faced with blown budgets and missed deadlines, organizations turned to Agile to increase the rate at which they could create new products and roll out updates.

Indeed, using a Scrum framework can speed up product development. But there’s little value if the advertising department can’t translate new products into modern vernacular, or if the marketing team can’t build a campaign in time. Even today, survey respondents say one of the areas their organization is most Agile in is technology (76%).
Yet agility belongs in the enterprise as a powerful management strategy—not isolated within one department—if it’s to move organizations forward into the future of workplace and cultural innovation. In fact, enterprise-wide agility sits at the heart of what separates today’s leaders from laggards.
“When companies are Agile from stem to stern, they’re able to make decisions of any size in less than an hour” for greater “profit, revenues, project success, promotion and market-share growth,” says Joe Justice, founder and CEO of Team WIKISPEED, a green, automotive-prototyping company that relies on Scrum for everything from human resource decisions to product design for modular cars.
So how can organizations extend agility from software to marketing, product design, manufacturing and other business units? It’s a question many are asking, especially since scaling Agile from a single department to an entire organization isn’t easy. While the vast majority of Forbes Insights/Scrum Alliance respondents still rely on a mix of traditional and Agile approaches, leaders are doing a much better—and faster—job of embracing Agile. Approaches currently employed by leaders include a mix of traditional and Agile (64%), mostly Agile (33%) and mostly traditional (3%).
Another impediment to enterprise-wide adoption of agility? Many organizations are adopting an ad-hoc approach to Agile, embracing it on an as-needed basis rather than applying it on regular, consistent terms. Overall, 21% of respondents use Agile when/where needed, and 23% use it within specific functions. Yet only 9% of respondents apply Agile enterprise-wide. Clearly, consistent and widespread application of Agile principles is critical to business success, as leaders are twice as likely to be Agile enterprise-wide as laggards.

## THREE STEPS TO INCREASE AGILITY 提升敏捷性的三个步骤

那么，组织如何能够超越普遍的愿望，以便更具适应性并实现企业范围内的敏捷性？ 我们的调查结果和深入访谈强调了敏捷在塑造高度竞争，创新领导者和缓慢采用的危险方面所起的关键作用，包括收入增长停滞和客户不满意。 根据这些数据，我们建议组织采取以下三个步骤来提高敏捷性，以获得明显的竞争优势：

1. 打造具有敏捷思维模式的高管团队 
2. 雇用并培养合适的人才组合 
3. 培养敏捷友好的文化和组织结构

这些战略使组织（其中许多组织被创新所颠覆）扩展整个组织的敏捷性，以实现可持续的业务增长和转型成功。

### 1. 打造具有敏捷思维模式的高管团队
为了在不断变化的世界中航行，组织需要敏捷的领导者。行政级别当然也不例外。高级管理人员对公司有一个全方位的视角，一个有利位置，可以让他们分配有意义的领导角色，并改变工作环境的动态。
“高层管理人员对敏捷性的支持几乎可以为任何类型的公司带来最高的投资回报，”Justice说。 “对诸如product backlogs和sprint backlogs等敏捷方法感到满意的高级管理人员，会对完成的工作和速度产生巨大影响。”
压力依旧：35％的受访者认为首席执行官负责组织敏捷性。 令人震惊的83％的受访者认为敏捷思维/灵活性是当今高层管理人员最重要的特征 - 高于管理/吸引人才的能力（79％），以及卓越的沟通者（76％）。 此外，87％的受访者认为CEO是组织敏捷性的最大支持者。
   
### 表5. 当今组织中敏捷的最大支持者和诋毁者


但是，当涉及到打造一个敏捷的企业，高管的责任可以不尽相同。 在Toyota Connected，执行团队成员和领导层每天开会，他们的职责是解决企业官僚主义和财务决策等障碍，这些问题在Scrum活动中经常出现。

在GE医疗集团，一家拥有190亿美元医疗产品和技术的制造商，C级管理人员通过激发思想，挑战思路和培养更敏捷的思维方式来提高组织敏捷性。 GE医疗集团首席创新官特里·布雷森汉姆说：“高层管理人员鼓励我们的团队问：'我们为创意工作做出了哪些假设？ 我们如何在不同文化，不同大洲，不同复杂程度的医疗保健中测试这些想法？ 我们是否考虑过整个工作流程？'“通过测试思维过程，Bresenham说，高级管理人员可以激发团队合作的氛围，培养更多创新因素，从而为更好的产品和更快乐的客户做出贡献。
但并非所有员工都能提高敏捷性。 根据我们的调查结果，组织敏捷性的最大诋毁者是长期雇员（29％） - 对当前角色感到满意并且坚定地抵制变革的工人。

Unisys公司首席信息官Upinder Phanda表示：“我们有一种规避风险的文化。 在我们说是之前，我们希望考虑过所有相关的因素。 但在今天的商业环境中，没有时间。 你需要承担风险。 我作为首席信息官的角色是帮助员工更快地做出那些冒险的决策。“即使是高管，由于对快速决策和更大风险承担的需求不断增加而受到惊吓，他们可以坚持传统的管理方法，而不是压倒性的糟糕结果。
作为回应，越来越多的高管正在进行大变革。 那些曾一度被认做大型组织中的支持部门正受到C级高管的鼓励，他们将自己的主张视为企业战略的塑造者。 从入门级人力资源代表到供应链经理，越来越多的员工发现自己正在为主要的企业计划做出贡献，并经常带头。 因此，另一种形式的领导力正在从例如人力资源和IT等受到敏捷采用影响的部门涌现出来。
在这些不同的职能中，人力资源部门可以与C级管理人员合作，消除敏捷性和培养部门间沟通方面的常见组织障碍。 IT团队还可以帮助提高整个组织的敏捷性。 一旦降级到服务器机房和办公室隔间，今天的IT领导者将监督支持大多数主要业务功能的云，自动化和数据分析系统。
Phanda表示，“IT正在改变其在公司中的角色，从仅仅是一个系统提供商到在IT，业务和供应商/实施合作伙伴之间进行协调。” 与此同时，数十年来，IT团队一直在实施敏捷框架，例如Scrum。 这种领导力和专业知识的结合使它们成为实现敏捷文化的完美合作伙伴。
然而，伙伴关系在清晰沟通方面蓬勃发展。 不幸的是，高层管理人员通常不会像人力资源经理和IT主管一样思考问题或交流想法。

> “解决客户的问题可能需要许多复杂的工作流程，因此我们建立了一个冲刺......这是一种让人们进行协作，承担责任并感受到赋能的方式。”
> TAMARA INGRAM
> CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,
> J. WALTER THOMPSON COMPANY

例如，首席执行官可能认为迫在眉睫的人才短缺是一个长期的财务问题，而人力资源和IT团队则更有可能将其视为更好地激励员工和奖励辛勤工作的迫切需要。 但是，通过更新他们的思维和使用的语言，并通过关注人际互动和客户价值等问题，高级管理人员可以更好地与人力资源和IT等业务功能一起工作，共同实现敏捷文化。


### 2. 雇用并培养合适的人才组合

66％的受访者表示，他们的转型非常或非常成功。 这种成功的核心是员工。 超过四分之三（83％）的领导者认为合适的人才和/或技能是成功转型的关键，而81％的领导者指出与所有利益相关者进行沟通。 相反，70％的领导者将缺乏高级管理人员和员工的参与归咎于转型失败的原因。
可以理解，转型需要一种新的工作方式。 企业敏捷性可以创建一个有效的学习和响应框架，减少非增值工作并始终如一地提供最大价值。 但是这项工作是由员工完成的，其中许多人习惯于以某种方式工作。 领导者如何推动组织敏捷性？
创造合适的人才组合至关重要。 这从培育健康的管道开始。 但是，员工培训和发展对于应对组织敏捷性转变带来的文化转变和新技能要求也至关重要。 事实上，54％的受访者已经培训和/或利用员工来领导敏捷转型。 对教育的需求没有显示出减弱的迹象，因为58％的受访者表示他们需要更多地了解敏捷性。
“基于敏捷性的培训，辅导和咨询被证明对公司具有财务价值，”Justice说。 但仅仅教育一线工人还不够; 高级管理人员还必须熟练掌握增量敏捷实践。 “传统的瀑布遗留项目管理高管甚至可能会失败，即使有一大批Scrum团队试图支持他或她 - 只是因为缺乏对敏捷的掌控。”
千禧一代特别适合增强敏捷企业的人才库。 通过鼓励快速决策，敏捷方法鼓励自我组织和自我管理的有动力的个人团队。 从入门级员工到高级管理人员的员工不仅有权做出决策，还鼓励他们通过项目和职位表达自己的价值观，利用他们的组织作为变革的催化剂。
除了评估个人并允许他们个人识别组织的职责外，组织敏捷性还可以促进交互和协作，重塑员工团队协作和交付成果的方式。例如，在GE Healthcare，项目范围从设计带有彩色编码安全警报的婴儿保温器到构建超低剂量CT扫描仪，以提高患者安全性。
对于这些举措和许多其他举措，GE Healthcare依赖于FastWorks，这是一个“利用敏捷和Scrum团队概念的GE计划”，Bresenham说。多学科团队在产品的整个生命周期中协同工作。 “不仅是技术工程人员，还有可靠性工程师，制造团队，采购团队，营销团队和监管团队，”Bresenham说。 “他们共同工作，并对需要发生的事情进行更全面的360度理解。在做出决策时，它们是全面的，这是解决不同问题的一种非常令人兴奋的方式。“
J. Walter Thompson是另一个依靠“合作文化”和合适的人员组合来建立敏捷企业的公司。美国营销传播公司J. Walter Thompson的首席执行官塔玛拉·英格拉姆说：“我们借鉴了科技公司的理念，实际上利用他们的软件平台来超越不同的时区，并在我们的能力范围内无国界。”
J. Walter Thompson在整个组织中嵌入敏捷方法的一种方法是在公司的所有领域使用Scrum进行决策和项目管理。
“我们的人才以文化的速度运作，共同创新冲刺，将不同学科和地区的想法汇集在一起​​，在短时间内解决特定问题，”英格拉姆说，他指的是一个可重复的工作周期，已完成并准备好进行审核。 “我们已经发展成为更多的'制造商文化'，从原型世界中学习。”从软件开发的一页开始，J。Walter Thompson现在依靠Scrum不仅创造产品，而且还用于人力资源和财务决策。


### 3. 培养敏捷友好的文化和组织结构

敏捷不是一套程序; 这是一种奖励个性，协作和适应性的心态。 其中大部分是关于改变组织文化和学习如何以不同方式管理人员。 好消息是，65％的受访者认为他们的文化对组织来说是一种资产。 66％的人认为敏捷性是公司DNA的重要组成部分。 然而，许多受访者使用诸如“无效沟通”（59％），“抵制变革”（57％）和“缺乏目的”（58％）等词语来描述其公司的文化。
部分挑战是将敏捷性融入公司的文化结构中。 “敏捷需要巨大的组织文化转变，”诺基亚的Erlemeier说。员工必须学习新的行为，例如独立思考，承担风险以及跨部门间的合作。集体企业本能一直在取消等级制度，这种想法是更少的头衔和职位将培养更多的合作和更强大的团队。
事实上，将近一半（44％）的受访者采用更扁平的结构来提高适应能力，而70％的受访者希望敏捷高管能够推广非等级文化。在未来一年，近一半（49％）的组织正在改变组织结构以支持敏捷方法。
敏捷就是为团队创建正确的动态，以便快速迭代并做出快速决策，而不是删除组织结构图上的空间。当然，层级结构可能会严重阻碍某些公司的进步。但是企业必须保持平稳才能成为敏捷的观念才是一个神话。敏捷企业不仅仅是消除层次结构;他们重新思考角色，为个人提供权力和自主权，以最大化商业价值。
例如，根据Erlemeier的说法，诺基亚“改写了其组织结构”以及员工通过“完全取消两层管理”所扮演的角色。因此，他说，“使用小型团队和更大的部落制度可以更快地做出决策。”该公司还根据他们的专业知识识别员工，而不是头衔或职位 - 这种修改可确保“最接近问题的人员获得授权”解决它，“Erlemeier说。 “这种新设置对于我们行业中规模不大的公司来说是独一无二的，我们的移动网络部门现在可以快速测试并提供比以前快10倍的新版本。”
即使经理的角色正在从监督人员转变为影响员工行为和鼓励传统瀑布流程退休。然而，用敏捷友好的文化取代“指挥和控制领导”并不容易。敏捷环境鼓励员工尽早失败并快速学习。但它们也取决于更大的个人所有权和问责制，对一些工人来说可能令人生畏的前景。通用电气医疗集团的Bresenham说：“我们是一个非常以绩效为导向的文化，因此对我们的员工来说，尝试某些事情，失败并向每个人讲述它是一种非常不自然的行为。”
Bresenham说，为了减轻顾虑，员工每季度会面一次，当时他们“认识到那些项目没有按照他们想要的方式发挥作用但又有勇气尝试新事物的团队。”更多的是庆祝而不是验尸这项练习在打开沟通渠道的同时消除了失败。
通用电气医疗集团在新兴市场引入更多实验和创新的另一种方式是DARE，该奖项颁发给一位自我提名的员工或团队，他们已经学习并希望从失败的努力或错过的目标中分享宝贵的教训。 “在这次活动中真是令人着迷的是，有更多的人举手示意，'我们确信这是正确的想法，但事实并非如此。以下是我们得到的以及为什么它不起作用。“重点不在于失败，而在于学习，”Bresenham说。
> “我们借鉴了科技公司的理念，实际上使用他们的软件平台超越了不同的时区，并且在我们的能力范围内无国界。”
> TAMARA INGRAM
> CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, J. WALTER THOMPSON

## 展望

75％的受访者致力于改变他们的组织结构，一种全新的领导方法正在迅速出现。英格拉姆预测说：“未来三到五年的领导力将是思考，创造和实现。” “这不是关于从前线领导;这将是关于参与。领导力将是通过为项目解决方案设定清晰的愿景并培养合适的人才来了解如何鼓励合作。“
但优秀的领导者需要企业敏捷才能茁壮成长。随着创新继续颠覆行业，对敏捷转型的需求将会增长。超越传统瀑布管理是一回事。另一个是在整个组织中扩展敏捷思维，结构和方法，从制造工厂到营销部门。
事实上，虽然69％的受访者对战略非常满意或非常满意，但只有55％的受访者对其执行感到满意 - 这表明设计敏捷战略比实施敏捷战略更容易。受访者提到的敏捷障碍包括竞争优先级（67％），缺乏敏捷拥护者（57％）以及不知道如何成为敏捷（56％）。
为了在整个组织中更好地采用敏捷性，许多受访者正在招聘第三方顾问（68％）;其他人正在为变革创造激励（55％）。 “通过提供经验，第三方提供商可以与公司取得良好的合作成功，”Justice说。 “在公司中拥有越来越多具有深厚Scrum经验的人员在项目交付速度方面具有根本性。”
除了争取第三方专业知识外，我们的调查结果和深度访谈揭示了成功实施敏捷转型的三个关键要求，包括支持性的高管，正确的人才组合和敏捷友好的文化。总之，这些关键因素可以支持组织在经济波动，要求客户和数字中断的时代的转型努力。
已经有了乐观的理由。展望未来，31％的领导者认为他们的公司将更加敏捷。但是，如果敏捷性是成功企业的生命线，那么组织必须学会在跨部门的边界上应用其权力。
